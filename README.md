## Description
If you are like me, You really don’t know what is happening in your neighborhood most of the time. What if an important meeting happens, theft or even death wouldn’t you like to know about it.

AreaCode a web application that allows you to be in the loop about everything happening in your neighborhood. From contact information of different handyman to meeting announcements or even alerts.

## Usage

### Issues

Flask_Script is not compatible with flask 2.1.2, which is what is used for this application. Downgrading Flask allows flask_script to run.. The cost of things(i.e escape) in Jinja wont work with versions of Flask less that 2.0.0
Setup
